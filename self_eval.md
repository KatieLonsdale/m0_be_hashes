# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I had trouble printing out a specific value. I couldn't find help on Google because a lot of the answers were using the format the lesson recommended we don't use. I put my question in the Slack chat and it was answered.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I have not been taking notes while doing assignments. The assignments have everything written out clearly and examples. When I don't remember something, I just open up the assignment page and read it there, which as been working well for me. I just take notes in class if there's something said that isn't on those pages.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
First I try changing the syntax since most of the errors I've encountered have been due to a missing comma, space, capital letter, etc. If that doesn't work after a few tries, I will either refer to the Turing assignments page or Google to find an example of how the code should look. For looking up methods, I have some Ruby Docs pages marked and use command + f to find what I need to quickly.
